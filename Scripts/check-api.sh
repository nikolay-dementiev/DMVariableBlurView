# line only marks where a source file ended. The compiler emits declarations in the
# order of the source files, so the top-level declarations are sorted: moving a type to
# another file must not look like an API change. An attribute that the compiler prints
# on a line of its own, such as @available, stays with the declaration below it, and a
# compiler condition (#if ... #endif) stays one block with what it guards: moving either
# to another declaration is an API change. A declaration whose own access level is
# private, fileprivate, internal or package is not API: it is dropped with its attribute
# lines and its block, which must follow the grammar of a hidden block stated below. A build

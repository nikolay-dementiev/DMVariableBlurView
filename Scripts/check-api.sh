# Header comments carry the compiler version and flags; imports are not API; an empty
# line only marks where a source file ended. The compiler emits declarations in the
# order of the source files, so the top-level declarations are sorted: moving a type to
# another file must not look like an API change. An attribute that the compiler prints
# on a line of its own, such as @available, stays with the declaration below it, and a
# compiler condition (#if ... #endif) stays one block with what it guards: moving either
# to another declaration is an API change. A declaration whose own access level is
# private, fileprivate, internal or package is not API: it is dropped with its attribute
# lines and its block, by indentation, as stated below. A build without library evolution

# Every line read must sit where the interface printer puts it, and a declaration that is not
# API is dropped by its indentation, never by counting its braces. The printer puts the members
# of a block two spaces deeper than the line that opens it and the closing brace at the
# indentation of that line; the body of an inlinable declaration it prints as written in the
# source, so a line of that body, its closing brace included, may sit at any indentation. A
# hidden declaration at indentation N goes with every following line indented deeper than N
# and, when its line ends with {, with the next line at indentation N that is exactly }. Any
# other line must be at the member level of the innermost open block, or be its closing brace;
# a compiler directive may sit anywhere. A line out of place stops the check with exit 2 and
# names its number, and so does a directive still open at the end.
#
# Each line from a hidden declaration to the end of its drop is checked for shape, and the
# shape is used only to refuse. The first line is a declaration; each line after it is a
# declaration, an accessor, a case, a line of attributes, a compiler directive or a lone { or }.
# A declaration has a declaration keyword after its attributes and modifiers, access levels
# among them, no = outside parentheses but the one of a typealias or an associatedtype, which
# names a type, and only plain single-line strings, numbers, nil, true, false or dotted members
# with balanced parentheses as default arguments. No checked line holds """, #, /* or */, the
# delimiters of text that spans lines. Any other line is a statement of a serialised body: the
# check stops with exit 2 and names its number. The shape decides nothing else: no brace is
# counted, and the drop still goes by indentation alone.
#
# Why this closes the family. A public member is lost only inside the drop of a hidden line
# that sits shallower, every line between them deeper than that line. Were the hidden line
# text of a multiline literal, the literal would close after it and before the member, which
# stands outside every body: on a line inside the drop, whose delimiter stops the check, or on
# a line no deeper than the hidden one, which ends the drop first. So the hidden line is code,
# and code of a body never passes as a hidden declaration: a local declaration takes no access
# level, the compiler nests no type in a body, a default argument or an initial value that the
# interface prints, and a statement, even one that starts with a variable named package, has no
# declaration keyword where a declaration has one. A hidden declaration of the printer drops
# nothing past its own block, because the printer puts the line after that block at its
# indentation or shallower. A crafted line that the shape accepts changes nothing, because
# nothing on it is counted.
